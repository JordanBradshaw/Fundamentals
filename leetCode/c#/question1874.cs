1874. Minimize Product Sum of Two Arrays

The product sum of two equal-length arrays a and b is equal to the sum of a[i] * b[i] for all 0 <= i < a.length (0-indexed).

    For example, if a = [1,2,3,4] and b = [5,2,3,1], the product sum would be 1*5 + 2*2 + 3*3 + 4*1 = 22.

Given two arrays nums1 and nums2 of length n, return the minimum product sum if you are allowed to rearrange the order of the elements in nums1.
